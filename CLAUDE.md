# WorldThreads — Development Guidelines

## MISSION

Create a vivid, excellent, surprising in-world experience that uplifts the user and provides engrossing, good, clean fun. Every design decision, prompt tweak, UX choice, and feature bet is measured against that. The craft stack (invariants, craft notes, conscience pass, inventories, snapshots, etc.) exists to serve that mission — characters that feel real, worlds that hold, scenes that are worth the visit and send the user back to their day nourished rather than hollowed.

## DATABASE SAFETY — CRITICAL

**NEVER drop, delete, or destroy database data during migrations.** This is the #1 rule.

- NEVER use `DROP TABLE` on a table that contains user data unless the data has been **verified** to exist in the new table first (count check).
- NEVER use `.ok()` to silently swallow errors during data migrations. Always check results.
- When recreating a table to change constraints (e.g., CHECK constraints in SQLite):
  1. Rename old table to `{name}_migrating`
  2. Create new table
  3. INSERT data from old to new
  4. **VERIFY the row count matches** before dropping the old table
  5. If counts don't match, **ROLLBACK** by renaming the old table back
  6. Wrap in `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF` / `ON`
- Prefer `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` over table recreation whenever possible.
- Always test migrations mentally against the current schema before writing them.
- When in doubt, do NOT migrate — find a workaround (e.g., store a different role value that passes existing constraints, or use application-level validation).
